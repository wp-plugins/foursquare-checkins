== Description ==

FourSquare Checkins with WordPress. View your last checkins as a list OR on Google Map on Pages/ Posts. Customize as per your need.
This plugin shows your last Check-ins on your wordpress blog/posts and also in Sidebar. Foursquare is primarily for letting your friends know where you are and figuring out where they are. 

Secondarily, it's for collecting points, prize "badges," and eventually, coupons, for going about your everyday business. And it's becoming popular. Foursquare now has almost 300,000 users in less than a year.
